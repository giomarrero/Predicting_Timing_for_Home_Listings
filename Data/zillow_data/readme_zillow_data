Dependent Variable:

Metro_med_doz_pending_uc_sfrcondo_week = Days to Pending: How long it takes homes in a region to change to pending status on Zillow.com after first being shown as for sale. 
The reported figure indicates the number of days (mean or median) that it took for homes that went pending during the week being reported, to go pending. 
This differs from the old “Days on Zillow” metric in that it excludes the in-contract period before a home sells.

less than the list price at the beginning of the month, divided by the number of unique properties with an active listing at some point during the month.
